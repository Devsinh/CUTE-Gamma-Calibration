This is the react app code for the CUTE Calibration widget. Any changes to this will change the CUTE Calibration widget in the Local CUTE_HUB. For implementation in the new mini mac, you should upload these to /Users/cute/source/CUTE_TRIUMF/cute_hub/src/components/CuteCalibrationComponents on the mini mac, run npm run build and update the file in /Library/WebServer/Documents/cute_hub. Do not change the name of the file since it is hardcoded in the react components.
